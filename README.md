# project-1

Are you a gamer who is pinching pennies? We've all been there, eating half a block of ramen while crying on the inside that games like Total War: Warhammer 3 are taking too long to download. Well, we cant help you with the download times, but we can help alleviate your food costs! We built this website for any/every gamer who has a limited budget. With this site, we compile deals from Steam, GreenManGaming, Fanatical, and many others to one easy to use page that will also convert the price to whatever major currency you might use!

This project was a major tackle for us, being the first time we utilized multiple APIs and a group collaboration.
